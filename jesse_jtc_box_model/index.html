      <p class="point-one">Content-box is the default</p>
      <p class="point-two">This box get's padding added on top of it's original height and width</p>
      <p class="point-three">The same happens with border and margin</p>
      <p class="point-four">So as you can see in this box when anything is added or taken away padding margin border it's always on top of the original height and width</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box-two">Let's take a look
      <p class="point-one">Border-box is more like what we would expect</p>
      <p class="point-two">This box has the padding subtracted from the original height and width</p>
      <p class="point-three">This is different because the border and margin are subtracted from the original height and width</p>
      <p class="point-four">This is the most like what we would expect padding margin border are all included in the original height and width</p>
