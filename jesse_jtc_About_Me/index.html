        <h1 class="h1">ABOUT ME</h1>
        <h2 class="h2">My Name Is Jesse Davis and I'm a passionate Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
        <img class="image" src="/public/purpose.png" alt="me with laptop">
        <p class="p1">I thrive on turning ideas into clean, powerful, production-ready software. I transitioned into tech after years in demanding industrial roles, and that background shaped the work ethic and intensity I bring to every project. When I build, I’m fully locked in — whether it’s React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node, or MongoDB, I love creating seamless user experiences backed by strong engineering.y.</p>
        <img class="image" src="/public/creativity.png" alt="arms crossed">
        <p class="p2">I specialize in projects that blend creativity with real-world functionality. I’ve built everything from Stripe-integrated donation systems to interactive apps that teach, guide, and support users. I care deeply about intuitive design, fast performance, and building products that feel polished and purposeful. If something isn’t excellent, I’ll refine it until it is.</p>
        <img class="image" src="/public/marine.png" alt="standing tall">
        <p class="p3">Right now, I’m focused on leveling up even further — pushing my skills, shipping meaningful projects, and finding a remote engineering role where I can contribute at a high level. I work hard, I learn fast, and I bring full ownership to every part of the development process. This career isn’t just something I do — it’s the path I chose, and I’m all in.</p>
